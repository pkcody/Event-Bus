# Event-Bus and Event-Queue

Sound On: https://pkcody.github.io/Event-Bus/

This project contains the Event Bus, Event Queue and Component patterns. This assignment is based off "Hands On Game Development Patterns with Unity 2019" by Baron David were we implement the Event Bus. Also, some concepts from "Game Programming Patterns" by Robert Nystrom were used to add an Event Queue. This uses the Event Bus and the Event Queue to build an enhanced event system. I added the different sounds, more events, and the event queue.
